## Hi, we invite you to cook climate friendly with us!

Our co-founder Judith loves to cook chard lasagna. From April - September, this is a seasonal dish that looks great, tastes great, and is easy to make.

### Chard-hazelnut lasagna approx. 430 gr. CO2 eq. per person
Ingredients for 4 people, April - September

- __12 lasagne sheets__
- 600 gr. ribbed chard
- 70 gr. celery
- 200 gr. carrots
- 1 onion
- 1 garlic
- 100 gr. Hazelnut
- 200 gr. tofu
- salt
- pepper
- 2 tablespoons canola oil

- __bechamel sauce__
- 3 tbsp almond meal
- 3 tbsp. white flour
- 600 ml. Milk
- white wine
- salt
- Pepper
- nutmeg

Pre-soak the lasagna sheets in lukewarm water. Separate the stems and the leaves from the ribbed chard. Cut both in small pieces. Boil the stalks in salty water for about 3 minutes, then add the leaves and boil everything together for another 2 minutes.  
Chop the onion, garlic and carrots. Heat the oil in a pan and fry everything for about 5 minutes. Add the blanched chard and sauté briefly. Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Add half of the hazelnuts at the end.

Preheat the oven to 220 degrees.

Mix the almond paste with the milk and heat it. Then add the flour (already pre-dissolved in a little water). Add flour until the liquid thickens a little (it remains quite liquid, it will become more solid in the oven). Season with white wine, salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Chop the tofu and mix this with the other half of the ground hazelnuts and the celery. Season with salt and pepper.

Now put all the ingredients in an oven dish. Start with a layer of lasagna sheets, then a layer of vegetables and then béchamel sauce until everything is used up. Sprinkle on the bottom layer of lasagna sheets a little ground hazelnut. The top layer should be béchamel sauce. Sprinkle the hazelnut and tofu mixture on top. Cook everything in the oven for about 30 minutes.

Delicious with fresh carrot salad or carrots just like that.  We wish you a good appetite!


Especially for cold days our co-founder Manuel recommends the potato vegetable curry with lentils.  You can of course adapt the vegetables seasonally and according to your taste.

### Vegetable-potato curry with lentils approx. 275 gr. CO2-eq per person
Ingredients for 4 persons, depending on the vegetables all year seasonal

- 1 kg potatoes
- approx. 600-700 gr. seasonal vegetables of your choice (cabbage stalks, mushrooms, carrots, leeks, celery, etc.)
- For example
- 300 gr. carrots
- 100 gr. leek
- 300 gr. cabbage stalk
- 1 onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 tbsp. oil (neutral flavor)
- 60 gr. peanuts
- 200 ml coconut milk
- 200 ml yogurt
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1.5 tbsp fresh ginger
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp garam massala or curry
- salt
- lemon juice

- __Lentil garnish__
- 250 gr. red lentils
- 1 tsp. fresh ginger
- cinnamon
- salt

Peel the potatoes, cut them into bite size square pieces and boil them in about 10 min until al dente (do not overcook!). Finely chop the carrots, leek, cabbage stalk. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan. Finely chop the onion, ginger and garlic and sauté them briefly. Add turmeric, cayenne pepper and cumin and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add the carrots, leeks and stems and bake for about 5 min. Add the cabbage leaves last. Rest from time to time. Add the coconut milk and the tomato brand. Let everything soften.
In the meantime, cook the lentils together with a teaspoon of fresh ginger with twice the amount of water until they are cooked. Then season the lentils with a little cinnamon, a little lemon juice and salt. Serve the lentils as a side dish with the curry.

When the vegetables are cooked to the bite, add the potatoes and mix everything well. Add the garam massala or curry spice.

Briefly roast the peanuts. Mix the yogurt with salt and lemon juice and serve the peanuts and yogurt separately as a side dish. Everyone can then take as much as they like.

Season the vegetable curry with salt, lemon juice and curry spice and possibly also with cayenne pepper.

Tip: You can serve naan bread or patati with it.
We wish you a good appetite!

# Eaternity Poster
This is educational poster of CO₂ values of food, arranged for a one-view spotting on what's good and what is bad for our climate.

## Plan / Todo
We want to build a website (jekyll? - github pages? - fancy animation), a forum (what software?), an FAQ to promote the poster.
If possible we want to crowdfund to place the poster as an appendix of newspapers (campact?).
It should be possible to order ( webstore?) the poster together with an optional sticker pack (design?) and other promotional material.
We put the poster source and the CO2 values into a public github repository for public use and external review (data format?).
We send a poster print to people we like (including our crowdfunders!)
Include the reference to CodeCheck for their awesome contribution and publishing of the data.
Get an ISBN number for the poster?


## LCA values
LCA values are contributed by various researchers. See also: https://eaternity.org/foodprint/database

## Food Unit normalization
To provide a meaning comparison between ingredients and how climate-friendly they are we normalize values with the FoodUnit. See also: https://eaternity.org/blog/Eaternity-Rating-Update

## Working document
The poster is released in version as a sketch document. See latest release here (github releases).

### Poster Klima-Legende

Der CO₂ Wert ist in Gramm CO₂-Äquivalente, jeweils pro 1 kg Produkt angeben.
★★★ Im Ziel der klimafreundlichen Ernährung (50% Besser) 
★★☆ Besser als der Durchschnitt
★☆☆ Schlechter als der Durchschnitt

Portionen: Werden für den fairen Vergleich angegeben. Sie werden auf der Nährwertbilanz des Produktes berechnet. Je höher die Zahl, desto mehr stillen 100 g vom Produkt deinen Hunger.
